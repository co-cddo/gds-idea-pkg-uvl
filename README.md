# gds-idea-pkg-uvl

_Brief description of your package._

## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) for pre-commit secret scanning (`brew install gitleaks`)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:co-cddo/gds-idea-pkg-uvl.git
   cd gds-idea-pkg-uvl
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

   This is done automatically when the project is first scaffolded.
   Pre-commit runs [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) on every commit
   to auto-fix lint issues and enforce formatting.

## Development

### Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Running linting manually

```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/
```

### Pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on `git commit`. They will:

- **Auto-fix** lint issues detected by `ruff check --fix`
- **Auto-format** code with `ruff format`
- **Check** YAML/TOML syntax, trailing whitespace, merge conflicts
- **Scan** for leaked secrets with gitleaks
- **Prevent** direct commits to `main`

If files are modified by the hooks, the commit will be aborted.
Review the changes, `git add` them, and commit again.

To run hooks against all files manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Versioning

This project uses [hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs) for
automatic versioning from git tags. Versions are never set manually.

On merge to `main`, the auto-release workflow creates a new tag based on
PR labels:

- `bump:major` — major version bump
- `bump:minor` — minor version bump
- (default) — patch version bump
